🐍 Road Safety Snakes & Ladders

An educational Snakes & Ladders game built in Python using Kivy, designed to promote road safety awareness through gameplay.

This project was originally developed during Class 11 as part of a school assignment, using a fixed, non-uniform road safety board image, which required manual pixel-based coordinate mapping for player movement.

🎯 Purpose

The goal of this game is to make learning traffic rules and road safety concepts engaging by integrating them into a familiar board game format.

Snakes represent traffic violations

Ladders represent good road safety practices

Each event displays an educational message
